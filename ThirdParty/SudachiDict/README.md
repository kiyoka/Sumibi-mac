The generator keeps common nouns with a kanji-containing surface and a
katakana reading, groups distinct surfaces under their hiragana reading,
removes readings with fewer than two surfaces, and retains up to 32 surfaces
per reading by Sudachi word cost. This is a candidate index, not a definition
or a semantic-equivalence dictionary. It does not include entries from the
GPL-licensed SKK-JISYO.L or the Emacs Sumibi generated dictionary.

When an additional-candidates response contains a whole-word hiragana
candidate, Sumibi appends up to 10 distinct dictionary surfaces after the LLM
candidate list. The dictionary is never sent to the LLM.
